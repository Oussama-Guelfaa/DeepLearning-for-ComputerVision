# ASL Object Detection Project

This directory will contain the code and data for the American Sign Language (ASL) object detection project.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can detect and localize hand signs in images, identifying the corresponding ASL alphabet letter.

## Planned Features

- Implementation of object detection models (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
- Training on ASL hand sign dataset
- Evaluation metrics for detection accuracy
- Real-time detection using webcam input

## Status

This project is currently in the planning phase. Implementation will begin after the completion of the ASL Classification project.
